AI Agents have quickly become the go-to architecture when making applications with LLMs. Agentic systems let the AI choose how to do a task using the tools it has, instead of just following a list of steps. This allows agents to be flexible and capable.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to create an agent that can:
- Use tools to perform actions
- Maintain conversation context
- Make decisions about next steps
- Handle complex multi-step workflows
